## Dashboard Overview:
The Power BI dashboard comprised two slides, each divided into three sections:

### Slide 1: Hiring, Promotions, and Turnover Rates
- Hiring:
    - Visualized the hiring trends with a bar graph showing new hires in FY20 by Job levels.
    - Used column and Line chart to show employee number based on gender hired in different job levels and showed the % of females hired for each department.

    - Created a bar graph which showed the average time for an employee (in years) to stay in a job for promotion to specific job levels, for men and women specifically.

- Turnover Rate (Leavers):
    - Designed two line charts to show Avg performance ratings of Leavers vs. non leavers. For men and women both.

### Slide 2: Performance Ratings, Executive Gender Balance, and Age Group

- Performance Rating:
    - Used a stacked bar chart to visualize the distribution of performance ratings based on the gender and also analyzed the difference between different rating for the genders.

- Executive Gender Balance:
    - Showcased four donut charts depicting the proportion of male vs. female executives in leadership roles for FY20 and FY21. Also showed the proportion between the executives hired and promoted - males vs. females.

- Age Group Distribution:
    - Created a bar graph showing the age group composition across job levels.
